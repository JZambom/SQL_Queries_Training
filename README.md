# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project was designed as part of a data analysis initiative for Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a former global movie rental company planning to re-enter the market with an online video rental service. The goal of this project was to leverage SQL to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Rockbuster's data, addressing key business questions and informing strategic decisions.

## Background and Context
Rockbuster Stealth faced stiff competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. To remain competitive, they sought to utilize their existing movie licenses to establish an online rental service. The data analysis was aimed at answering strategic questions, such as identifying high-revenue movies, understanding customer behavior across geographic regions, and analyzing rental patterns.

## Key Objectives
The project aimed to answer critical business questions, such as:
- Which movies contributed the most or least to revenue?
- What is the average rental duration for all movies?
- Where are the most valuable customers located?
- Do sales figures vary significantly between different geographic regions?

These questions required loading and querying the provided dataset in a relational database, followed by visualizations and summaries that could be presented to the Rockbuster management team.

## Methodology and Tools
- **Database Environment**: The data was loaded into a PostgreSQL RDBMS.
- **Data Analysis**: Queries were written to extract insights about movie revenue, rental patterns, customer distribution, and sales variations.
- **Techniques Applied**:
  - SQL CRUD operations and data filtering using `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses.
  - Data joining, summarization, and cleaning.
  - Use of subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to streamline complex analyses.
- **Presentation**: Results were visualized and formatted into clear reports for business and technical stakeholders.

## Deliverables
This project includes:
- A set of SQL scripts showcasing queries that answer the key business questions.
- A final analysis report that compiles findings, visualizations, and data insights.
- A data dictionary outlining the schema of tables used and key metrics analyzed.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I demonstrated the ability to:
- Write and optimize SQL queries to derive business insights.
- Present analytical findings with clarity and impact through visual storytelling.
- Collaborate and translate technical outputs into actionable business recommendations.
